Tagz
====================

## About

#### Tagz is a terminal client for managing files tagging
It is conceived to be cross-platform and cross-"cloud provider" to easily share tags with your colleagues
and family members

## Features

* Cross-platform
* Each directory will have a special __tagz file that stores tags for the other files in the same folder
* When you back up a folder, the __tagz file gets backed up as well
* Works with your cloud provider sync app of choice so that your colleagues immediately get the updated tags

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install tagz -g
tagz --help
```
